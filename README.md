# JamboCare - Language Translator Application

Welcome to the JamboCare GitHub repository! JamboCare is a translator app designed specifically to be used in translating language in primary healthcare settings, where communication
between healthcare professionals and patients is critical

## Structure

The repositories are structured as follows:

- [Backend](https://github.com/Ruby-GOL/Jambocare_backend): This repo contains the backend code of the JamboCare platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.
- [Frontend](https://github.com/Ruby-GOL/Jambo-care-frontend): Here, you will find the frontend code for the JamboCare platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Redux. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the JamboCare platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

JamboCare leverages Generative AI models to enhance the platform's functionality, particularly in the domain of visual question answering (VQA). The chosen Generative AI models, such as the `dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa` model, have been fine-tuned to process and interpret images containing questions from users. These models utilize cutting-edge techniques in computer vision and natural language processing to generate accurate and meaningful responses to user queries.

By incorporating Generative AI models into ATRONS, we enable users to ask questions about visual content, such as diagrams, images, or screenshots, and receive relevant answers. This significantly enhances the learning experience, as users can obtain detailed explanations, insights, or clarifications about the resources they are interacting with. It opens up new possibilities for interactive and dynamic learning, making ATRONS a powerful platform for knowledge sharing and acquisition.
